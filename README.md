This is a repository where I will store components and blocks. 
Consider it as a set of ready-made solutions, which you will need to finalize a little bit for your project.

Repository of components and blocks - [StoryBook ](https://basovich.github.io/storyBook/storybook-static/)

[Telegram channel](https://t.me/frontuha_bratuha)

## How it works:
1. Select the component we need. 
2. In the Controls tab change the necessary settings, add text.
3. Open the HTML tab, copy the markup and paste it into your project.
4. Next, find [here](https://github.com/Basovich/storyBook/tree/main/stories) folder with the necessary component/block. The folder will contain a style file and possibly js files.
5. In the stories.js file you can find the script initialization for the component/block, if there is one. This part of the initialization should be added to your project.
6. Note, if you copy a block, you will also need to download styles and script for the components that will be in that block.

## Notes 
All components are encapsulated from each other.

Note that my project has [some global styles](https://github.com/Basovich/storyBook/tree/main/stories/global/style) and uses normalize, this has a direct effect on the display of components/blocks.
